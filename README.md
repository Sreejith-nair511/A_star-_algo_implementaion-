The A* algorithm is called OR graph/tree search algorithm. 

----> A* algorithm incrementally searches all the routes starting from the start node until it finds the shortest path to a goal.

----->It is a very efficient algo for graph traversal and helps in pathfinding ,especially the shortest one 

------>This program in python uses pygame module to visualize this by taking two points in the grid and drawing obstruction

------->when engaged it will find the shortest path between the two points of grid
